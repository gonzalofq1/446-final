# Numerical Solution for the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation


This is the the code for the final project for ESAM 446 with Prof. Daniel Lecoanet. This project was prepared by Divjyot Singh and Gonzalo Ferrandez Quinto.

# Running the code

To regenerate the simulations presented in our report, simply run the scripts in SchrodingerPDE.ipynb using a Python Kernel. This Jupyter notebook includes the code for all of our simulations and visualizations
